                <font size="+1">Sometimes, this involves speaking uncomfortable truths to power and demanding more than
                    people think is
                    possible. It’s hard work. But the pressures facing our planet and its people are too important for
                    us to
                    compromise.

                    Friends of the Earth strives for a more healthy and just world. We understand that the challenges
                    facing
                    our planet call for more than half measures, so we push for the reforms that are needed, not merely
                    the
                    ones that are politically easy.</font>

                            communities, seeks to change the perception of the public, media, and policymakers — and
                            effect policy change — with hard-hitting, well-reasoned policy analysis and advocacy
                            campaigns that describe what needs to be done, rather than what is seen as politically
                            feasible or politically correct. This hard-hitting advocacy has been the key to our
                            successful campaigns over our 47-year history.</p>

                        <p>The world’s problems are too big for tiny fixes around the edges. We are working to transform
                            our economic and political systems through strategic reforms that lead to systemic, radical
                            changes. The corporate pesticide industry douses our environment with billions of pounds of
                            toxic pesticides every year and uses their outsized influence to block fundamental
                            protections for people and the planet. But, using the power of our grassroots membership, we
                            convinced the world’s largest garden retailers, Home Depot and Lowe’s, along with Walmart,
                            Costco and more than 135 others, to phase out bee-killing neonicotinoid pesticides.</p>

                        <p>We are committed to growing and strengthening our activist base to fight for change.
                            In order to build long-term political power, we collaborate with broader movements, because
                            the fight to protect our planet is intrinsically tied to the global struggle for justice.
                            When a political appointee or a threatening piece of legislation looms, we work together to
                            stop it. Trump’s corrupt EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt was attacking our clean air and
                            water while cozying up to corporate polluters. We worked with our members and our partners
                            across the broader movement to get him out of office.</p>
